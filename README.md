## Hello!
Welcome to the Magnetic Stirrer project repository! It started in the year 2019 as an universtity project. We work on a low cost, open source bioreactor with a volume up to 4 l. As one sub-project, a low friction stirrer with multiple replaceable stirrer geometries is developed by modifying a simple commercial magnetic stirrer. It is supposed to work as a stand-alone stirrer as well as to be controlable via web interface.

Software and hardware will be described later. If you are interested, you can read a bit more about the idea behind the project in this README.

## How everything started
We are a group of Master students in the field of life sciences. With the opening of the new student's Makerspace at our campus, a Makerspace-related class should be launched at the same time. A lot of steps took place in a short time and soon, a team was found to participate in the first class taking place as a pilot project. Laboratory scaled bioreactors are part of several lab courses at university. But as most courses are only meant to be half-day events, it was not possible to observe and compare the growing of microorganisms in live until now. For that purpose, we want to develop a system, which may be controled and observed via an web interface. For providing this sytem with only low costs, the bioreactor is constructed by material available in almost every lab as well as by self-created tools, perfectly adapted for the named application. Additionally, the communication will be realized by a bus-system.

## Who is behind all this?
We are students at the Technical University of Munich [university website](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/).
