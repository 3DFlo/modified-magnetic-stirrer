## Hello!
Welcome to the Magnetic Stirrer project repository! It started in the year 2019 as an universtity project. We work on a low cost, open source bioreactor with a volume up to 4l. The software and hardware will be described later. If you are interested you can read a bit more about the idea behind the project in this README.

You can directly jump to the sections:

- [How everything started](#what-are-your-bacteria-doing-when-you-are-not-looking)
- [A bit of background](#why-would-somebody-be-interested-in-bacteria-movements)
- [What's to solve?](#let-me-present-to-you-the-problem)
- [How can you contribute?](#how-can-you-contribute)
- [And why should you contribute?](#and-why-should-you-contribute)

## What are your microbes doing when you are not looking?


## Why would somebody be interested in microbes movements?


## Let me present to you: The Problem


## How can you contribute?

The project can be divided into two parts:

## And why should you contribute?

If you like to try something new or you want to train your 3D design and coding skills this project is perfect for you! You can play around with computer vision and at the same time solve a scientific problem. Additionally you will learn a bit about microbes and how microbiologist characterize them.

And ultimately we might be able to publish the results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (which is open access of course!) or at least at a the preprint server [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) and you will be listed as co-author!

## Who is behind all this?
I am a PhD student at the Technical University of Munich, combining microbiology, plant sciences and biochemistry in my research. I love 3D printing, recreating scientific instruments and getting lost on unnecessary nerdy projects. LightM (formerly MBac)started as one of such nerdy projects but turned into something unexpectedly useful. If you want to know about other things I do and have done so far you can visit [my personal website](http://alexanderkutschera.com/) or follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/alexwastooshort).
