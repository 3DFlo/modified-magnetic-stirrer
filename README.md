## Hello!
Welcome to the Magnetic Stirrer project repository! It started in the year 2019 as an universtity project. We work on a low cost, open source bioreactor with a volume up to 4l. A modified magnetic stirrer for a small biolab reactor. This will be a low friction stirrer.

The software and hardware will be described later. If you are interested you can read a bit more about the idea behind the project in this README.

You can directly jump to the sections:

- [How everything started](#how-everything-startet)
- [A bit of background](#why-should-you-care-about-bioreactors)
- [What's to solve?](#let-me-present-to-you-the-problem)
- [How can you contribute?](#how-can-you-contribute)
- [And why should you contribute?](#and-why-should-you-contribute)
- [Who is behind all this?](#who-is-behind-all-this)



## How everything startet


## Why should you care about bioreactors?


## Let me present to you: The Problem


## How can you contribute?

The project can be divided into two parts:

[Hardware](#) :hammer:


[Software](#) :dvd:



## And why should you contribute?

If you like to try something new or you want to train your 3D design and coding skills this project is perfect for you! You can play around with computer vision and at the same time solve a scientific problem. Additionally you will learn a bit about microbes and how microbiologist characterize them.

And ultimately we might be able to publish the results in a peer-reviewed scientific journal (which is open access of course!) or at least at a the preprint server [BioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) and you will be listed as co-author!

## Who is behind all this?
We are students at the Technical University of Munich [university website](https://www.tum.de/nc/en/).
