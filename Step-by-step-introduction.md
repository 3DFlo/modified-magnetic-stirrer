## Step-by-step-introduction

How to create YOUR OWN modified magnetic stirrer

### 1. 3D-models and hardware

- Choose your magnetic stirrer and the bottle you want to use as a fermenter

- Choose your stirrer geometries

- Buy a shaft system and a bar magnet

- Choose and buy the filament for your 3D-printer

- Measure and determine your geometric dimensions

- Create your 3D models with any software (we used AutoDesk Inventor Professional)

You need to create the agitator shaft, the stirrer geometries, the shaft nut and your torque support

- Test the ideal settings for your 3D-printer

- Start the first test prints

- Improve your models and print at least your final version

- Assembly together the single stirrer parts

- Drill and tap an M4 threaded hole into your shaft to connect the shaft system with the printed agitator shaft

- Drill two holes into the cap to fix the shaft system and fix it with two screws and nuts

- Screw the cap on the bottle and put it onto your magnetic stirrer and test the function

- Your mechanical work is done ðŸ˜Š

 

### 2. Electronics and software

- Buy your electronic components and make sure you have all your tools

- Connect your electronics (see our electrical layout)

- Write your code (you can use ours as orientation, but there is of course still potential for improvements)

- Test your system and program (you need to hold the hall sensor close to the magnet)

- If Everything works, put the motor into the torque support and fix the torque support at the magnetic stirrer

- Stick the hall sensor onto the magnetic stirrer close to the magnet but not in the center

- Connect everything again and see your stirrer working ðŸ˜Š
